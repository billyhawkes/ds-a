# Tree
- Consists of nodes in a non-linear parent/child relationship
- Contains a root (top), edges (connection between nodes) and leafs (node with no children)
- Ex. DOM, heirarchy (ex. family, folders, company), AI (Decision tree), etc


## Binary Heap
- Each node has at most 2 children
- Max Heap: Parent is always larger than children
- Min Heap: Parent is always smaller than children
- No implied ordering between siblings


## Traversal
- Searching
	- Depth first: deep into one path than the next
		- Uses Stack
	- Breadth first: level by level
		- Uses Queue
